# Internet of Things (IoT) Projects
## Purpose
Develop:
* interfaces to sensors and actuators on a ZigBee network
* controllers that incorporate sensor data into actuator commands
* user interfaces for configuring the control laws
* device health monitoring
* analysis of data collected

## Assumptions
* The projects in this repository assume the ZigBee network is accessed through a ConBee II.  The interface to this product is provided through an application that provides an REST API.  This API is documented at https://dresden-elektronik.github.io/deconz-rest-doc/.
